# UofT_STA442-2101

This repository provides some coursework and projects for STA442/2101: Methods of Applied Statistics I in Fall 2019.

Please note STA442/2101 this year is very different from previous year. It is more similar to the previous STA2201: Methods of Applied Statistics II. Please do learn from this repository and pay attention to the academic integrity.

More info is available at Professor's website(Hopefully it will always kept): http://pbrown.ca/teaching/appliedstats

I hope this will help people who learn this course at UofT or anyone who is interested in advanced statistical model (GLMM, Bayesian model, Time series or Survival analysis).
