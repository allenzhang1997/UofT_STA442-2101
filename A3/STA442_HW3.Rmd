# CO2 Report

## Introduction

We investigate the changes in atmospheric Carbon Dioxide concentrations from an observatory in Hawaii. The oldest data is collected on 1960-03-30 and the newest is collected on 2019-07-09. The data point is sparser when the data is collected earlier. We hope to discuss if the CO2 data appears to be impacted by a series of events.

## Methods

We used a Generalized Additive Model from the Gamma family with a log link function to predict carbon concentration. Plotting the data , the plot shows that there are seasonal trends and an upward increase in time, which are pattern for a time series. We use time as random walk 2 random effect. We also eliminate the effect of seasonal changes by considering yearly fluctuations and biyearly fluctuations.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&Y_{i} \stackrel{}{\sim} \Gamma(\lambda_{i}, \theta_{i})\\
&log(\lambda_{i}\theta_{i}) =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sin(2\pi x_i)+ \beta_{2} cos(2\pi x_i) +  \beta_{3}sin(4\pi x_i) + \beta_{4} cos(4\pi x_i) + U(t_{i})\\
&U(t) - 2U(t-1) + U(t-2)\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_{U})\\
\end{aligned}
$$
We note that $Y_{i}$ is the response variable, represents the ppm of CO2, following a Gamma distribution with $Gamma(\lambda_{i}, \theta_{i})$. $sin(2\pi x_i)$ and $cos(2\pi x_i)$ represent yearly fluctuations and $sin(4\pi x_i)$ and $cos(4\pi x_i)$ represent biyearly fluctuations. $\theta_{i}$ is the scalar for the gamma distribution. We did not add other random effect beacuse the current model already gives good estimation.

With prior:

- $\lambda_{i}$ follows $pr(1/ \sqrt{\lambda} >2)=0.5$.

- $\sigma_{U}$ follows an exponential distribution with $pr(\sigma_{U} >log(1.01)/26)=0.5$.

## Result

From the CO2 concentration plot (see Appendix), we can say that CO2 concentration increases despite the seasonal changes. Then it is more meaningful to look at the increasing speed of the CO2 concentration.

We approximated the first derivative of the time trend using a finite difference approximation. The approximation is also graphed in figure 1. I add several timelines to indicate the changes during the time indicated.

- The red line corresponds to 1973-10-17, when the OPEC oil embargo began. It seems CO2 concentration increases faster afterwards.

- The orange line and the yellow line corresponds to 1980-1982, global economic recessions. CO2 concentration increases slower during this recession comparing with the time before and afterwards.

- The green line corresponds to 1991-11-1, when the Berlin wall fell. The industrial production is stimulated, and CO2 concentration increases faster after it.

- The blue line corresponds to 2001-12-11, when China joined the WTO and grow rapidly in industrial production afterwards. It seems increasing speed of the CO2 concentration is not influenced significantly by this event.

- The purple line corresponds to 2008-9-15, when the Lehman Brothers bankrupted, and the most recent global financial crisis started. It seems CO2 concentration increases faster afterwards.

- The pink line corresponds to 2015-12-15, when the Paris Agreement is signed and intended to limit CO2 emissions. It shows that growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere is lower now that it has been in the recent past.

# Heat Report

## Introduction 

We use daily maximum temperature data recorded on Sable Island from 1900 to now to test whether IPCC statement about the global warming is true or not. The The IPCC states that "Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0째C of global warming above preindustrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8째C to 1.2째C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5째C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate."

## Method 

Putting all the data point in one plot does not show any pattern for time series data. Instead, we should used a student-t Bayesian Model with suitable piror to predict the temperature. Only the maximum temperature from summer (month 5-10) are taken to be the response variables as we are advised. Plotting the data , the plot shows that there are seasonal trends and an upward increase in time, which are pattern for a time series. We use each week's data as random walk 2 random effect. We should also allow some fluctuations between each week and each year so we take **year** and **week** as iid random effect. Fitting yearly fluctuations and biyearly fluctuations into the model eliminates the effect of seasonal changes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\sqrt{s \tau }(y_{i}-\eta_{i}) \sim T_{\nu}\\
&\eta_{i} =\beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} sin(2\pi x_i)+ \beta_{2} cos(2\pi x_i) +  \beta_{3}sin(4\pi x_i) + \beta_{4} cos(4\pi x_i) + U(t_{i})+ U_{i,week}+ U_{i,year}\\
&U(t) - 2U(t-1) + U(t-2)\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_{U})\\
&U_{i,week}\stackrel{ind}{\sim}N(0,\sigma_{week}^{2})\\
&U_{i,year}\stackrel{ind}{\sim}N(0,\sigma_{year}^{2})\\
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that $sin(2\pi x_i)$ and $cos(2\pi x_i)$ represent yearly fluctuations and $sin(4\pi x_i)$ and $cos(4\pi x_i)$ represent biyearly fluctuations. $s$ is a fixed scaling and $s > 0$, $y$ is the response variable and $\eta$ is the linear predictor. $T_{\nu}$ is a reparameterized standard Student-t with $\nu$ > 2 degrees of freedom with unit variance for all values of $\nu$. $U_{week}$ and $U_{year}$ represent weekly and yearly random effect.

Prior:

- Precision parameter $\tau$ follows $pr(1/ \sqrt{\tau} >1)=0.5$. Note if using student-t change that hyperparameter it will have $pr(log(\tau) >1)=0.5$

- The degree of freedom $\nu$ has $pr(\nu >10)=0.5$. Note if using student-t change that hyperparameter it will have $pr(log(\nu -2) >10)=0.5$

- $\sigma_{U}$ follows $pr(\sigma_{U} >0.1/(52*100))=0.05$.

- $\sigma_{week}$ follows $pr(\sigma_{week}>10)=0.5$. We allow a relative large difference between weeks.

- $\sigma_{year}$ follows $pr(\sigma_{week} >1)=0.5$. We allow a relative small difference between weeks.


## Result

The Table 1 shows that all fixed effect is significant under 95% CI. The Table 2 shows the standard deviation for random effect. In this table, "sd for week" means the standard deviation of random walk 2 weekly fluctuation and is 0. The total standard deviation is contributed by iid week and year random effect.

Based on our model, we generate a 95% credible interval prediction plot (Figure 2).

We use the blue line represents the base line, which means basically the preindustrial temperature. In the beginning of 20th century, when human activities have not influenced the temperature, the median temperature is 11.55. From the plot, we can see that the 95% CI contain that temperature for a rather long period.

Nowadays (2019-11-1), the median temperature is approximately 12.80 degrees (marked in the black line). The lower bound is 12.15 (green line) and the upper bound is 13.45 (red line). Our result shows that there is approximately 1.25 째C of global warming above preindustrial levels, with a likely range of 0.6째C to 1.9째C by now. This is similar to the IPCC's statement: "Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0째C of global warming above preindustrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8째C to 1.2째C".

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Heat plot prediction under 95 percent credible interval, current prediction",out.width='70%', out.height='70%', fig.align="center"}
mySample = inla.posterior.sample(n = 24,
  result = sableRes, num.threads = 8, 
  selection = list(week = seq(1,
  nrow(sableRes$summary.random$week))))
weekSample = do.call(cbind, lapply(mySample, function(xx) xx$latent)) 
matplot(weekValues[-1], sableRes$summary.random$week[,
  paste0(c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975), "quant")], 
  type = "l", lty = c(1, 2, 2), xlab = "time", 
  ylab = "degrees C", xaxt = "n", col = "black", xaxs = "i")
forXaxis2 = ISOdate(seq(1880, 2060, by = 10), 1, 1, tz = "UTC")

abline(h=11.55 , col="blue")
abline(v = ISOdate(2019, 11, 1, tz = "UTC"), col = "black")
abline(h=12.8, col="black")
abline(h=12.15899 , col="green")
abline(h=13.43446 , col="red")
```

In another plot (Figure 3), we predict that by 2030, the median temperature will be 13.10 (black vertical line) and by 2052, the median temperature will be 13.74 (black vertical line). The upper and lower bound become larger beacuse the longer period makes the prediction less precise. The median temperature has increased 1.55째C by 2030 and 2.19째C by 2052. There is clear tendency that median line continue to increase. So the result was slightly different from the IPCC statement that "Global warming is likely to reach 1.5째C between 2030 and 2052.". The number 1.5째C was more conservative for the temperature changes between 2030 and 2052.

abline(v = ISOdate(2052, 1, 1, tz = "UTC"), col = "black")
```

In Figure 4, we generate a larger sample illustrating some possible prediction curves based on the model. Though it is possible that the temperature can go down again, the trend is clearly upward.

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Sample predictions form the model", , out.width='70%', out.height='70%', fig.align="center"}

axis(1, forXaxis2, format(forXaxis2, "%Y"))
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the IPCC statement is rather reliable. Though the number are slightly different, the trend is predicted well. Some numbers the IPCC use is even more conservative. Considering data was recorded on Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia, it is understandable that the climate change is more significant for places near the Arctic.
